Kittens back-end prototype (monolyth version)

## But why is it in Python? ðŸ™€

(actual question from a friend!)

It's a prototype. I have a lot of Python experience from my Old Daysâ„¢, so I figured I could get up to speed quickly this way. I could also get up to speed quickly using Node, but between the two, Python has grpc reflection, and I also thought it would be nice to refresh my Python skills.

For the â€˜realâ€™ implementation, it will be a microservices architecture, so really individual components could be in any languageâ€¦ but the plan is to do it mainly in Rust.
